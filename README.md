# QuizApp
QuizApp Frontend for the given [Backend](https://github.com/JulianBu/QuizAppBackend). 

This Application is a Quiz for car fans, petrolheads, and so-called car guys. The App fetches random Questions from the Backend which the user can answer and 
can earn some points to prove der knowledge about all in car culture and motorsport. 

### How to Start

This App only works with the Backend. If you want to try it out, you need to start the Spring-Service first. After that, you can start a virtual Android device and 
you can now create an account/user. The Backend checks if your user is valid. 

You can also insert new Questions. For now, every question is straight going into the Database.
